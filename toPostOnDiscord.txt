  - look and feel 5
  - navigation 5
 goal: 
  In this deliverable, data received 
  from users, generated, or sent to users is stored in a data store residing behind a web server. 
  There will be no hard-coded data as of deliverable #2 as data will go to/come from the data 
  store. Also, you might need to revisit some of the features you implemented in deliverable #1. 



TODO:
- An installation guide stating how to deploy your website 
- A user guide showing how to use your website. 
- host a poll and reserve demo time accordingly
