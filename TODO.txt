Task Progress

how:
 - If you can break down the features you may add them into the TODO: list
 - please only reserve max 3 tasks at the time before taking another tasks 
    so there's no conflict and that other team members can continue the task 
 - for fairness back up a copy of your own DONE list 
 - if you finished implementing a feature add it to FeaturesImplemented.txt cause we need to submit it at demo


notes:
 - for simplicity im thinking of mirroring the look of concordia's main website

Doing:
 IH - setting up github codespace https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-a-codespace/working-collaboratively-in-a-codespace
 - set up home page (html)



TODO:
- An installation guide stating how to deploy your website 
- A user guide showing how to use your website. 
- host a poll and reserve demo time accordingly
- host teamwork discussion meeting (ensure the fairness of the work) (not IH, im already tired)
   please be fair so that the meeting can be quick and short (i dont want no drama)



DONE:
 IH - setting up the goals and system to effectively do the project
